### Description

Smooth and full animation using bitblt without the use of timers. Also demonstrates various other graphics-related APIs. IMHO one of the best, if not the best, slot machine on PSC ^^. (Fully Commented) Uses APIs such as Bitblt, LoadImageA, CreateCompatibleDC etc... (I had to resubmit because I included the wrong module in previous submission)
 
### More Info
 
mdlTime.bas and it's usage throughout the project was added later on. E-mail for any questions/comments at s1011112@rogers.com
